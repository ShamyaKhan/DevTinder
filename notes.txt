Tech Planning:
-> 2 microservices
-> Frontend (react)
-> Backend (node js, mongodb)

LLD:
-> DB design: 
-> User: firstName, lastName, emailId, password, age, gender
-> ConnectionRequest: fromUserId, toUserId, status (pending/accepted/rejected)
-> API design: REST API
-> CRUD operation

Request Handler:
-> res.send() will send the response and no more request handler will be executed
-> It will only go to the next request handler if we call next()


Important:
-> A server should listen to requests after connecting to database
-> Server cannot read json data by default
-> API level validation, DB level validation
-> In TCP/IP protocol, we make an API call, get the data and the connection is closed
-> When we log in, server generates a JWT and sends it back to user inside a cookie
-> The user stores the JWT in browser
-> Whenever the user will make an API call, the token will be sent along with the request 
-> For every request, the server will validate the token 
-> To store the token and send it with every request, we use cookies
-> When we log in, server sends the token inside a cookie
-> When writing schema methods, never use arrow function
-> Create enum when we want to restrict user for some values
-> DB indexing: query will be faster, DB will be optimized
-> MongoDB automatically creates index for the field where unique: true
-> Compound index:
