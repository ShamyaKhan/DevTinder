Tech Planning:
-> 2 microservices
-> Frontend (react)
-> Backend (node js, mongodb)

LLD:
-> DB design: 
-> User: firstName, lastName, emailId, password, age, gender
-> ConnectionRequest: fromUserId, toUserId, status (pending/accepted/rejected)
-> API design: REST API
-> CRUD operation

Request Handler:
-> res.send() will send the response and no more request handler will be executed
-> It will only go to the next request handler if we call next()
-> A server should listen to requests after connecting to database
-> Server cannot read json data by default

Important:
-> API level validation, DB level validation
